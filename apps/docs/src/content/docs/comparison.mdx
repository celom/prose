title: When to Use Flume
description: Understand where Flume fits compared to Temporal, Effect-TS, XState, and other tools.

Flume is an **in-process** workflow orchestration library. It runs inside your existing Node.js process with zero external dependencies. Before adopting it, it's worth understanding what it does _not_ try to be.

## Not a durable execution engine

If you need workflows that survive process restarts, resume after hours or days, or coordinate across distributed services, look at [Temporal](https://temporal.io), [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com), or [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev). These require infrastructure (servers, queues, databases) but give you persistence and replay guarantees that an in-process library fundamentally cannot.

## Not a full effect system

[Effect-TS](https://effect.website) is more powerful in every technical dimension — typed errors in the return signature, type-level dependency injection via Layers, fibers, streams, and a massive standard library. If your team can invest in learning its functional programming model, Effect is the more capable choice. Flume trades that power for simplicity: pure `async`/`await`, no monads, no new paradigms to learn.

## Not a state machine

[XState](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate) models workflows as finite state machines with explicit states, transitions, and guards — ideal for complex non-linear flows with many possible state transitions. Flume is designed for sequential (or branching) business logic pipelines where a state machine's verbosity would be overhead.

## Not a result type library

Libraries like [neverthrow](https://github.com/supermacro/neverthrow) or [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) encode errors in return types (`Result<T, E>`, `Either<E, A>`). Flume does not — steps throw, and failures are wrapped in `FlowExecutionError`. If typed error channels are critical to you, Effect or neverthrow are better fits.

## Where Flume fits

Flume is for teams building backend services with multi-step business logic (process an order, onboard a user, handle a payment) who want structured retries, timeouts, transactions, observability, and type-safe state threading — without adopting new infrastructure or a new programming paradigm.

| Need | Tool |
|------|------|
| Durable workflows, cross-service orchestration | Temporal, Inngest, Trigger.dev |
| Full effect system with typed errors | Effect-TS |
| State machines with complex transitions | XState |
| In-process business logic pipelines | **Flume** |
